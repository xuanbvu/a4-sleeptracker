6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
No, it is a generic app tailored towards the average smartphone user.


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
No, we wanted it to work with both platforms.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
A person can log overnight sleep in the app by setting the start time and the end time and clicking submit.
This will put the overnight sleep into the general storage which allows them to view, compare, and access the data easier as we 
wanted it to not have much hassle when doing so.


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
A person can log sleepiness during the day in the app by submitting info after sliding the bar to the correct scale.
We chose to support logging sleepiness in this way because it was easiest to show the different scales of data.


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
A person can view the data they logged in our app by going to the home page.
We thought this would be an accurate way to summarize the logged data with easy view.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
We chose backing up logged data.


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?



13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
The data backs up to ionic storage that is throughout the app.

14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
The app implmement principles of good mobile design because it is intuitive to use, has error checking, has an error message
to show when the user has done something wrong, and has a useful initial view because you can see all the data you logged
upon signing into the app.
